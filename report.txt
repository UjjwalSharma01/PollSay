3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 System Architecture Overview

PollSay uses a hybrid architecture combining:
1. Client-heavy processing for UI rendering and encryption
2. Serverless backend using Supabase for data storage and authentication
3. Minimal traditional server for specialized operations

The architecture can be visualized as follows:

Browser Client <--> Supabase (Serverless) <--> PostgreSQL Database
       |                  |
       |                  |
       v                  v
Local/Client       Supabase Storage
Encryption

This hybrid approach allows PollSay to leverage the benefits of serverless architecture while maintaining the security requirements of client-side encryption.

3.2 Frontend Architecture

PollSay's frontend is built using:
- Pure JavaScript: Chosen over frameworks like React or Vue for simplicity, faster initial load times, and reduced bundle size
- Tailwind CSS: Used for utility-first styling that provides rapid UI development capabilities without the overhead of custom CSS files
- Chart.js: Implemented for data visualization in the analytics dashboard

The decision to use vanilla JavaScript instead of a popular framework was based on several factors:
- Smaller bundle size and faster initial load time
- Relatively simple state management needs
- Better browser compatibility without transpilation
- Reduced dependency overhead for security auditing

For state management without a framework, PollSay uses:
- Module-level state through ES modules
- Custom event listeners for component communication
- Local storage and session storage for persistent state
- Query parameters for shareable state

3.3 Backend Architecture

The backend infrastructure is built primarily on Supabase, which provides:
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication services
- Storage solutions
- Real-time capabilities

Additionally, PollSay uses:
- Node.js/Express: Limited server-side code for tasks that can't be handled client-side
- Supabase Functions: For serverless backend operations

Supabase was chosen over Firebase due to:
- PostgreSQL's robustness and SQL query capabilities
- Row-level security policies for fine-grained access control
- Open-source nature with no vendor lock-in
- Better local development experience
- More predictable pricing at scale

3.4 Database Design

The database model consists of several core tables:

1. users: Managed by Supabase Auth
   - Basic user identity and auth info

2. profiles
   - Extended user information
   - Preferences and settings
   - Links to organization

3. organizations
   - Organization metadata
   - Settings and configuration

4. team_members
   - Joins users to organizations
   - Role-based permissions
   - Invitation/activation status

5. forms
   - Form schema and configuration
   - Created by user/organization
   - Access controls and settings

6. form_responses
   - Unencrypted form responses
   - Metadata about responses
   - Links to forms and respondents

7. encrypted_responses
   - Encrypted form data
   - Encryption metadata
   - Keys for authorized access

The database is designed with organization-based multi-tenancy, where all data is organized by organization, with team members having specific roles.

5. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 End-to-End Encryption

PollSay implements client-side encryption using the Web Crypto API, which provides:
- RSA (2048-bit) for asymmetric encryption of keys
- AES-GCM (256-bit) for symmetric encryption of form data
- SHA-256 for hashing and PBKDF2 for key derivation

The encryption workflow consists of:

1. Organization Key Generation:
   - Each organization generates an RSA key pair
   - Private key is encrypted with admin's passphrase
   - Only encrypted private key is stored in the database

2. Form Encryption:
   - For encrypted forms, a unique AES key is generated
   - Form key is encrypted with organization's public key
   - Form data is encrypted with the form-specific AES key

3. Response Decryption:
   - Admin provides passphrase to decrypt the organization's private key
   - Private key is used to decrypt the form key
   - Form key is used to decrypt individual responses

This approach ensures that the server never sees unencrypted sensitive data (zero-knowledge architecture), and even database administrators cannot access encrypted content.

5.2 Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement PostgreSQL RLS policies following these principles:
1. Ownership-based access: Users can always access their own data
2. Organization-based access: Members can access organization data based on role
3. Explicit sharing: Forms can be shared via unique codes
4. Public access: Some resources can be marked public

RLS policies ensure that data isolation between different organizations is enforced at the database level, not just in application code.

5.3 Pseudonymization Approach

To enable anonymous feedback while maintaining the ability to track individual respondents across multiple responses, PollSay implements a pseudonymization approach:

1. Combining user email with organization ID to create a unique input
2. Hashing this input with SHA-256
3. Creating a human-readable format (e.g., "HappyTiger#a1b2c3") from the hash

This ensures consistency for the same user across responses while maintaining anonymity. The pseudonyms are generated client-side to maintain privacy.

5.4 Authentication and Authorization

PollSay's authentication flow consists of:
1. User signs up/in through Supabase Auth
2. JWT token provided to client
3. Token contains user ID and claims
4. RLS policies use auth.uid() to enforce access
5. Token refresh handled automatically by client

The system implements role-based access control at both the application level and database level, with organization admins able to invite team members and control encryption settings.

6. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation follows several key principles:

1. Event Handling:
   - Centralized navigation module for consistency
   - Event delegation for improved performance
   - Defensive coding with proper null checks

2. UI Components:
   - Reusable component patterns without a framework
   - Progressive enhancement for backwards compatibility
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

3. Client-Side Processing:
   - Form validation before submission
   - Data encryption and decryption
   - Local caching for improved performance

Code example for event delegation:
```javascript
document.querySelector('nav').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.matches('a')) {
    // Handle navigation link clicks
  }
});
```

6.2 Backend Implementation

The backend leverages Supabase's capabilities, with custom extensions:

1. Database Functions:
   - Helper functions for common operations
   - Security-critical operations as database functions
   - Complex queries encapsulated in functions

2. Real-time Updates:
   - Subscription-based real-time events
   - Filtered subscriptions for performance
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

3. Storage Management:
   - Secure file upload and download
   - Content-type verification
   - Access control for stored files

Example of a database function for checking admin status:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin_of_org(p_user_id UUID, p_org_id UUID) 
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM public.team_members
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id
      AND org_id = p_org_id
      AND role = 'admin'
      AND status = 'active'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```
