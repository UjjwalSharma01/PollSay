i want to add end to end encryption in my application which is essential working like google form means you can create the form and get the responses from the people

the database that is used is supase essentially okkay and apart from this

this how i want this to work

people's should be verified with a specific emails given by the organization that can participate within the poll b people have the option either to show their pseudonomus name or the real name

there is this dashboard

which will sessentially show the metrics like avg completion time of the form

obviously the pie chart showing the share of each option provided in a very elegant manner

there is a option to import all the responses and the questions all of that in the form of a CSV as well

a recent activity section

Recent Activity New response received Customer Feedback Form 2 mins ago Form completion milestone reached Employee Survey 1 hour ago New form published Product Feedback 3 hours ago

un this format

Metrics like this

Total Responses 1,234 ↑ 12.5% vs last week Completion Rate 87% ↑ 5% vs last week Avg. Time to Complete 4m 32s ↓ 2% vs last week

now i have few questions

What kinda encryption technique is suitable for this compare with other techniques available for efficiency and why u came to a specific type

how do i implement it actually in the db and the entire process so that it is now slowing down the entire application

how to implement this response analytical dashboard i have the frontend ready but not the backend
