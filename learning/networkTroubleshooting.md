# Network Troubleshooting Guide for PollSay

This document provides guidance for resolving common network-related issues encountered in the PollSay application.

## Common Errors and Solutions

### 1. ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED

**Error Message:**  
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

**Causes:**
- DNS resolution failure
- Network connectivity issues
- Incorrect URL formatting
- API endpoint not available

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Network Connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. **Verify API Endpoints**: Make sure all API endpoints are correctly configured
3. **DNS Cache**: Clear browser DNS cache or try a different network
4. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure CORS is properly configured if making cross-origin requests
5. **Supabase Configuration**: Verify your Supabase project is active and properly configured

### 2. 406 Status Error

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 ()
```

**Causes:**
- Server cannot provide content according to the Accept headers sent in the request
- API version mismatch
- Incorrect content type negotiation
- Rate limiting

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Headers**: Ensure your request includes proper Accept headers
2. **API Version**: Verify you're using the correct API version
3. **Rate Limits**: Check if you've hit Supabase rate limits
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement exponential backoff for retries

### 3. Reference Errors in Dashboard

**Error Message:**
```
ReferenceError: documentsCount is not defined
```

**Causes:**
- DOM elements referenced before they exist
- Typos in element IDs
- JavaScript execution order issues

**Solutions:**
1. **Element IDs**: Ensure all referenced DOM elements exist with correct IDs
2. **Load Order**: Make sure scripts run after DOM elements are available
3. **Error Handling**: Add defensive coding with null checks
4. **Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistent naming between HTML IDs and JS references

## Preventing Network Issues

1. **Implement Error Boundaries**: Catch and gracefully handle network errors
2. **Offline Support**: Consider implementing offline-first functionality for critical features
3. **Status Indicators**: Show loading/error states to keep users informed
4. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for easier troubleshooting
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to alert on increased error rates

## Supabase-Specific Considerations

### Rate Limiting

Supabase implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. If you're hitting rate limits:

1. **Optimize Queries**: Reduce unnecessary API calls
2. **Batching**: Batch multiple operations into single requests where possible
3. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Upgrade Plan**: Consider upgrading your Supabase plan for higher limits

### Connection Pooling

For high-traffic applications:

1. **Connection Management**: Be mindful of connection pool limitations
2. **Release Connections**: Ensure connections are properly released
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor connection usage to prevent pool exhaustion

## Testing Network Resilience

1. **Simulate Poor Connectivity**: Test your app under various network conditions
2. **Error Injection**: Deliberately introduce errors to test handling
3. **Load Testing**: Verify performance under heavy load
4. **Network Throttling**: Use browser devtools to simulate slow connections
