# PollSay Backend Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions, data flow, and technology choices in PollSay's backend implementation.

## System Architecture Overview

PollSay uses a hybrid architecture combining:
1. **Client-heavy processing** for UI rendering and encryption
2. **Serverless backend** using Supabase for data storage and auth
3. **Minimal traditional server** for specialized operations

## Data Model

### Core Tables

1. **users**: Managed by Supabase Auth
   - Basic user identity and auth info

2. **profiles**
   - Extended user information
   - Preferences and settings
   - Links to organization

3. **organizations**
   - Organization metadata
   - Settings and configuration

4. **team_members**
   - Joins users to organizations
   - Role-based permissions
   - Invitation/activation status

5. **forms**
   - Form schema and configuration
   - Created by user/organization
   - Access controls and settings

6. **form_responses**
   - Unencrypted form responses
   - Metadata about responses
   - Links to forms and respondents

7. **encrypted_responses**
   - Encrypted form data
   - Encryption metadata
   - Keys for authorized access

## Security Model

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement PostgreSQL RLS policies following these principles:

1. **Ownership-based access**: Users can always access their own data
2. **Organization-based access**: Members can access organization data based on role
3. **Explicit sharing**: Forms can be shared via unique codes
4. **Public access**: Some resources can be marked public

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up/in through Supabase Auth
2. JWT token provided to client
3. Token contains user ID and claims
4. RLS policies use `auth.uid()` to enforce access
5. Token refresh handled automatically by client

### Encryption Architecture

PollSay implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive form data:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Each organization generates an RSA key pair
   - Private key encrypted with admin's passphrase
   - Only encrypted keys stored in database

2. **Form Encryption**:
   - For encrypted forms, a unique AES key is generated
   - Form key encrypted with organization's public key
   - Form data encrypted with the form-specific AES key

3. **Response Decryption**:
   - Admin provides passphrase to decrypt organization's private key
   - Private key decrypts the form key
   - Form key decrypts individual responses

4. **Zero-knowledge Architecture**:
   - Server never sees unencrypted sensitive data
   - Encryption/decryption happens in client browser
   - Even database admins cannot access encrypted content

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

PollSay leverages Supabase's auto-generated REST API with custom endpoints for specialized operations:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Handled by Supabase's PostgREST
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections via Supabase Realtime
3. **Custom Functions**: PostgreSQL functions for complex operations

### Function Examples

```sql
-- Helper function to check if user is admin of org
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin_of_org(p_user_id UUID, p_org_id UUID) 
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM public.team_members
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id
      AND org_id = p_org_id
      AND role = 'admin'
      AND status = 'active'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to create a new form
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_form(p_user_id UUID, p_form JSONB)
RETURNS JSONB AS $$
DECLARE
  v_org_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Check if user is admin
    IF NOT is_admin_of_org(p_user_id, v_org_id) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'User is not an admin of the organization';
    END IF;
    
    -- Insert form into database
    INSERT INTO public.forms (data)
    VALUES (p_form)
    RETURNING * INTO v_form;
    
    RETURN json_build_object('id', v_form.id);
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER; 

```
Interview Q&A: Backend Architecture
Q: Why did you choose Supabase over Firebase for this application?
Answer: We selected Supabase for several key reasons:

PostgreSQL: Full relational database capabilities vs Firebase's NoSQL approach
Row-Level Security: Native database-level security for fine-grained access control
SQL Power: Ability to use complex queries, joins, and transactions
Open Source: No vendor lock-in, can self-host if needed
Local Development: Better local development experience
Cost Structure: More predictable pricing at scale
For our application, the structured data model and complex access patterns were better suited to a SQL-based approach.

Q: How do you ensure data integrity with client-side encryption?
Answer: We implement several safeguards:

Schema Validation: Before encryption, we validate data against JSON schema
Signature Verification: Each encrypted payload includes a signature
Version Tagging: Encryption formats include version tags for future compatibility
Redundancy: Critical data has checksums to verify successful decryption
Backup Keys: Organization admins can securely back up encryption keys
Graceful Degradation: System fails securely when decryption isn't possible
Q: How would you scale this architecture to handle millions of users?
Answer: To scale to millions of users, I would:

Database Scaling:
Implement read replicas for analytics and reporting queries
Shard data by organization for largest customers
Add specialized caching layer for frequent queries
Storage Optimization:
Move binary data to object storage with CDN
Implement tiered storage based on access frequency
Performance Enhancements:
Add Redis for session state and caching
Implement connection pooling and query optimization
Use materialized views for complex dashboards
Architecture Evolution:
Move specific high-volume operations to dedicated microservices
Implement queue-based processing for background tasks
Add regional deployments for global performance

Q: How do you handle data migrations and schema changes?

Answer: We follow a structured process:

1. **Version Control for Migrations**:
   - Each schema change is tracked in a versioned migration file
   - Migrations are applied sequentially and are immutable
   - Both up and down migrations are provided for rollback

2. **Zero-Downtime Approach**:
   - Additive changes first (new tables, columns)
   - Application code updated to support both schemas
   - Transition period where both schemas are valid
   - Cleanup phase to remove deprecated structures

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Migrations tested on database clones
   - Automated tests verify data integrity
   - Performance impact evaluated before deployment

4. **Tooling**:
   - Use Supabase CLI for local development migrations
   - CI/CD pipeline validates migrations before deployment
   - Automated backups before applying migrations

5. **Handling Sensitive Data**:
   - Special care for migrations affecting encrypted data
   - May require key rotation or re-encryption strategies
   - User notification for potentially disruptive changes
